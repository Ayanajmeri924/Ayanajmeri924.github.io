                    <P><i>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears;
                         and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. 
                         A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.</i></P>

                    <P><i>The black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), also known as the American polecat[2] or prairie dog hunter, is a species of mustelid native to central North America.
                        The black-footed ferret is roughly the size of a mink and is similar in appearance to the European polecat and the Asian steppe polecat. It is largely nocturnal and solitary,
                         except when breeding or raising litters.Up to 90% of its diet is composed of prairie dogs.</i></P>

                    <h3><br>Addax</h3>
                <p><i>The addax (Addax nasomaculatus), also known as the white antelope and the screwhorn antelope, is an antelope native to the Sahara Desert.
                     The only member of the genus Addax, it was first described scientifically by Henri de Blainville in 1816. As suggested by its alternative name,
                    the pale antelope has long, twisted horns – typically 55 to 80 cm (22 to 31 in) in females and 70 to 85 cm (28 to 33 in) in males.
                    Males stand from 105 to 115 cm (41 to 45 in) at the shoulder, with females at 95 to 110 cm (37 to 43 in). They are sexually dimorphic,
                    as the females are smaller than the males. The colour of the coat depends on the season – in the winter, it is greyish-brown with white hindquarters and legs,
                     and long, brown hair on the head, neck, and shoulders; in the summer, the coat turns almost completely white or sandy blonde.</i></p>

                    <h3><br>Northern bald ibis</h3>
                    <P><i>The northern bald ibis, hermit ibis, or waldrapp (Geronticus eremita) is a migratory Old World bird found in open areas such as grasslands, rocky habitats and semi-deserts, often close to running water. This 70–80 cm (28–31 in) glossy black ibis, which, unlike many members of the ibis family, is non-wading, has an unfeathered red face and head, and a long, curved red bill. It breeds colonially on coastal or mountain cliff ledges, where it typically lays two to three eggs in a stick nest, and feeds on lizards, insects, and other small animals.

                        The northern bald ibis was once widespread across the Middle East, northern Africa, southern and central Europe, with a fossil record dating back at least 1.8 million years. It disappeared from Europe over 300 years ago, although reintroduction programmes in the region are underway. In 2019 there were about 700 wild birds remaining in southern Morocco, and fewer than 10 in Syria, where it was rediscovered in 2002 but where their number declined in the following years, maybe to zero.</i></P>

                    <h3><br>Cross River gorilla

                    </h3>
                    <P><i>The Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli) is a critically endangered subspecies of the western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla). It was named a new species in 1904 by Paul Matschie, a mammalian taxonomist working at the Humboldt University Zoological Museum in Berlin, but its populations were not systematically surveyed until 1987.

                        It is the most western and northern form of gorilla, and is restricted to the forested hills and mountains of the Cameroon-Nigeria border region at the headwaters of the Cross River (Nigeria). It is separated by about 300 km (190 mi) from the nearest population of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), and by around 250 km (160 mi) from the gorilla population in the Ebo Forest of Cameroon. Estimates from 2014 suggest that fewer than 250 mature Cross River gorillas remain, making them the world's rarest great ape. Groups of these gorillas 
                        concentrate their activities in 11 localities across a 12,000 km2 (4,600 sq mi) range, though recent field surveys confirmed the presence of gorillas outside of their known localities suggesting a wider distribution within this range. This distribution is supported by genetic research, which has found evidence that many Cross River gorilla localities continue to maintain contact through the occasional dispersal of individuals. In 2009, the Cross River gorilla was finally captured on professional video on a forested mountain in Cameroon.</i></P>

                    </h3>
                    <P><i>The saola (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis), also called spindlehorn, Asian unicorn, or infrequently, Vu Quang bovid, is one of the world's rarest large mammals, 
                        a forest-dwelling bovine native to the Annamite Range in Vietnam and Laos. It was described in 1993 following a discovery of remains in Vũ Quang National Park
                         by a joint survey of the Vietnamese Ministry of Forestry and the World Wide Fund for Nature.
                        Saolas have since been kept in captivity multiple times, although only for short periods as they died within a matter of weeks to months.
                         The species was first reported in 1992 by Do Tuoc, a forest ecologist, and his associates. The first photograph of a living saola was taken in captivity in 1993. 
                         The most recent one was taken in 2013 by a movement-triggered camera in the forest of central Vietnam. It is the only species in the genus Pseudoryx.</i></P>

                    <h3><br>Amur leopard</h3>
                    <P><i>The Amur leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis) is a leopard subspecies native to the Primorye region of southeastern Russia and northern China. It is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List, as in 2007, only 19–26 wild leopards were estimated to survive in southeastern Russia and northeastern China.

                        As of 2015, fewer than 60 individuals were estimated to survive in Russia and China. Camera-trapping surveys conducted between 2014 and 2015 revealed 92 individuals in an 8,398 km2 (3,242 sq mi) large transboundary area along the Russian-Chinese border. In 2019, it was reported that the population was about 90 leopards.In 2021, it was reported the population was about 110 individuals.
                        
                        Results of genetic research indicate that the Amur leopard is genetically close to leopards in northern China and Korea, suggesting that the leopard population in this region became fragmented in the early 20th century.[8] The North Chinese leopard was formerly recognised as a distinct subspecies (P. p. japonensis), but was subsumed under the Amur leopard in 2017.</i></P>

                          is one of two species of crocodiles found in the Philippines; the other is the larger saltwater crocodile
                           (Crocodylus porosus). The Philippine crocodile, the species endemic only to the country,
                            went from data deficient to critically endangered in 2008 from exploitation and unsustainable fishing methods,
                             such as dynamite fishing. Conservation methods are being taken by the Dutch/Filipino Mabuwaya foundation,
                              the Crocodile Conservation Society and the Zoological Institute of HerpaWorld in Mindoro island. 
                        It is strictly prohibited to kill a crocodile in the country, and it is punishable by law.</i></P>

                         duck of the genus Aythya. Thought to be extinct in the late 1990s, specimens of the species were rediscovered at
                          Lake Matsaborimena near Bemanevika in Madagascar in 2006. By 2017, a captive breeding program had produced a
                           population of around 90 individuals. The birds were reintroduced to the wild in December 2018.

                        The Madagascar pochard feeds mainly on aquatic insects, unlike other diving ducks in the same genus, Aythya. 
                        Ducklings begin making short dives at around 14 days old, before which they feed on the surface.</i></P>

                    <h3><br>Giant panda    </h3>
                    <P><i>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China.
                         It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish 
                         it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Adult individuals average 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb), and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m 
                         (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long. The species is sexually dimorphic, as males are typically 10 to 20% larger. The fur is white, 
                         with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. A thumb is visible on the bear's forepaw, which helps in holding bamboo 
                         in place for feeding. 
                        Giant pandas have adapted larger molars and expanded temporal fossa to meet their dietary requirements.

                        Giant pandas are only found in six mountains in a few provinces. They are also found in elevations of up to 3,000 m (9,800 ft).
                         Its diet consists almost entirely of bamboo, making the bear mostly herbivorous, despite being classified in the order Carnivora.
                          The shoot is important to bears, as it contains starch and is 32% protein, hence pandas evolved the ability to effectively digest starch.
                           They are solitary, only gathering in times of mating. Females rear cubs for an average of 18 to 24 months.
                            Potential predators of sub-adult pandas could be the leopard. Giant pandas heavily rely on olfactory communication to communicate
                             with one another; scent marks are used to chemical cues and on landmarks like rocks or trees. Giant pandas live long lives, 
                             with the oldest dying at 38.</i></P>
